      "This story is a kind of blog, with my results added as images, but for each image or set of images I've added a link to the corresponding IPython Notebook which contain all the code and algortithms necessary to produce the images.

Image 1 shows the whole the time-series on the left and a zoom of the time-series on the right. It's clearly visible that the two signals are similar but with a different phase."
